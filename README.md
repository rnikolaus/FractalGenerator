FractalGenerator
================

A multithreaded generator for fractals.
You can change the number of threads for calculation or choose a calculation
 method with Java 8 streams.
Basically fractals are a fun way to play around with multithreading as the calculation can be done in parallel.

If you want to play around with it, it's best to use Netbeans and Maven
